# MNIST-Autoencoder
This project implements an autoencoder trained on the MNIST dataset to reconstruct images of handwritten digits. The model learns to compress each image into a lower-dimensional latent space and then rebuild it from that representation, providing a simple and effective demonstration of unsupervised learning and feature encoding within a NN.
